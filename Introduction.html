		<h2>How to Beat Gears of War 3 Horde on Insane Difficulty</h2>
		<br /><br /><br />
		<div>
			Horde mode in Gears of War 3 has 50 waves. The Locust attack by wave and try to kill you and your allies by many different means. 
			The waves come in intervals. In each successive wave, more types and more difficult enemies attack. 
			There is a 30 second break between each wave so you can rest.
			The Locust Horde attacks with different types of enemies. The different enemies are as follows:
			<br />
			<ul>

				<li><b>Brumak</b> - a huge Locust monster with rockets and miniguns attached to him.</li>
				<li><b>Reavers</b> - a squad of large flying Locust that shoot rockets and have Locust riding them.</li>

				<li><b>Gunker</b> - a group of very large Lambent that can extend their arms far to melee you and can shoot huge Immulsion Mortar attacks.</li>
				<br /><br />The goal of the game is to win all 50 waves, meaning at least one person survives each wave after killing all the Locust.
				The scope of influence for completing this task is the millions of players on Xbox Live that will see the achievements on your gamer profile for 
				beating Horde on Insane. The goal is worthwhile because any person that has ever played the game will know that you are a true pro and will hold 
				you in the highest respect due to this great and very challenging achievement. It also gives the player a very great feeling of satisfaction and pride.<hr />
