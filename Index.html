			<br />
			Gears of War 3 is a third person shooter game in which Horde mode is one of the multiplayer game types. In Horde mode, waves of enemies 
			called Locust are attacking you and any coop gamers you may have with you. Additionally there are also Lambent enemies, who are Locust 
			Infected with Immulsion, a powerful fuel found on the planet Sera, where the game takes place. Lambent are hostile to the Locust and the player, 
			and they also combust upon death. This Web Quest will show you how to beat Horde mode on the 
			Insane difficulty setting, which is the hardest setting there is.
